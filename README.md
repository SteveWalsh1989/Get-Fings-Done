# todo--vuetify

basic enough task/ todo application to test out the vuetify framework

- using some vue 3 style and composition api for setup layout
- still using vuex for state management as not implementing apis
- trying out browser storager using localbase

Interested in testing out the following around Vuetify

- basic component usage
- How easy it is to customise components
- accessability features

## Project setup

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
npm run build
```

### Customize configuration


* if getting errors on node version, run `export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider` in console before `npm run serve` 

See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
